# FirstRepo
This is our first repository. A intensive github mastery revisit covering branching, pull, push, remote team work administration and version control etc.

This is our working directory

Also note: this is not the basic setup. This code has been modified during production of one of our courses. If you want the bare starter, make sure to actually use the DefaultWeb project.
